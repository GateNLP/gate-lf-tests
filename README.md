# Pre-configured ML tasks for testing the GATE LearningFramework

This contains pre-configured pipelines for training and evaluating 
various ML models on standard-datasets.

To simplify getting started, all the necessary data/documents are already included
in the repository.

## IMPORTANT: Using the correct LearningFramework version!

In order to use this repository for testing with a specific LearningFramework version, 
the version number in the various pipelines must be correct and some details
in the piipeline may need to correspond to that version of the LF as well.

In order to achieve this, there is a different branch in this repository for each 
version of the LF to use it with, e.g. v4.1.1-SNAPSHOT or v4.2 (the part after the "v" 
matching the maven version of the LF).
